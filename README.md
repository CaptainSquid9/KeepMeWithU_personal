# Keep Me With U Personal Project

## A way to keep me in contact with my family as I move to college
  Worked on cable management and programming to connect it to my google drive folder using google API
  This was the original intention of the project which I then adapted for the Hackathon
  
Typescript React Web App.
  An old phone-stand in the front door of my old room showcasing all my adventures in college
  Use Google Drive API to generate a slideshow that automatically updates with new photos taken from your device
  Allows family members to be a part of my life without having to rely on additional hassles or constant updating
